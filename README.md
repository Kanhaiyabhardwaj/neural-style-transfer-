# Neural Style Transfer Using VGG19

## Overview

Neural Style Transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to create a new, stylized image. This project uses the VGG19 model, pretrained on ImageNet, to achieve this by optimizing an image to match the content of a base image and the style of a reference image.

## Project Structure

- `neural_style_transfer.ipynb: Main script that performs neural style transfer.
- `base_image.jpg`: Base image with the content to be transferred.
- `style_image.jpg`: Style image from which the artistic style will be transferred.
- `output/`: Directory where the resulting images are saved.
